Welcome to the Rock-Paper-Scissors AI Game! This project is a simple implementation of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game enhanced with an AI component. The AI uses a machine learning model to predict your next move based on your previous choices, making the game more engaging and challenging.

## Features
- **Rock-Paper-Scissors Gameplay**: Play the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game.
- **AI Prediction**: The computer uses a machine learning model to predict your next move and respond accordingly.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: *Coming soon!* The GUI is still under development and will be added in a future update.
